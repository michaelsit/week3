// Goal: Play a simple game of craps
// - Begin with the recipe (algorithm) and code from the first practice

// - Implement the (basic) rules of craps:
//   - If the total of the two dice is 7 or 11, the player wins
//   - If the total of the two dice is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses
//   - If the total is anything else, the "point" is set, e.g. "the point is 6"

// Write the recipe (algorithm) in the comments. Write the code.

// Store the value of the first die in memory. Write it out to the console in a human-readable format.

// Store the value of the second die in memory. Write it out to the console in a human-readable format.
let die2 = getRandomInt(6)

// Store the value of the total of the two dice in memory. Write it out to the console in a human-readable format.
let total = die1 + die2
